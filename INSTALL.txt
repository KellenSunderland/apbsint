Introduction
============

The Approximate Bayesian Inference Toolkit (ApBsInT) is a lightweight
implementation of a number of algorithms for approximate Bayesian inference,
applicable to a range of probabilistic models. The range of approximations,
algorithms and supported models is set to grow. At present, the main focus
is as follows.

1) *Probabilistic models*: Factor graphs of continuous variables. Each factor
   is a univariate potential of a linear combination of the variables.

   * Generalized linear models
     - Linear regression: Gaussian noise, double exponential noise
     - Binary classification: probit and logistic regression
     - Count data: Poisson and negative binomial regression
     - Quantile regression

   * Sparse (generalized) linear models
     - Laplace prior
     - Mixture of Gaussian prior
     - Spike and slab prior

2) *Bayesian inference approximations*: At present, the focus is on variational
   (deterministic) approximations. The posterior distribution over latent
   variables is approximated by a Gaussian distribution (called the
   *backbone*), which can either be unconstrained or fully factorized (all
   variables are pairwise independent).

   * Expectation propagation

3) *Algorithms*

   * General (fully coupled) Gaussian backbone. Parallel (synchronous) updates
     on all potentials

   * General (fully coupled) Gaussian backbone. Sequential updates on
     potentials, random or actively chosen schedule. The backbone is updated
     by way of rank one updates of a Cholesky decomposition

   * Fully factorized Gaussian backbone. Sequential updates on potentials,
     random or user-defined schedule. This is a generalization of loopy
     belief propagation to non-Gaussian models.

ApBsInT is written in Python. A number of core routines are implemented in
C++, both for efficiency and to interface with numerical libraries. A part
of the functionality is duplicated in Matlab, mainly for the purpose of
testing.

This toolbox is in an early alpha stage. At present, it appeals to users with
a certain degree of knowledge about probabilistic modelling and the abilities
to get their hands dirty. The build system is only partly automated, and apart
from test examples, there are no general-purpose applications implemented at
present.

On the other hand, the implemented techniques are well documented, and great
care is taken to ensure numerically robust behaviour. Unit test code is
supplied on a case-by-case basis. Contributions on all levels are highly
welcome.

Prerequisites
=============

ApBsInT consists of Python code, Matlab code, and C++ code. The latter exports
APIs both towards Python and Matlab. These APIs can be built seperately. The
Python (Matlab) code works only together with its successfully built C++ API
(respectively).

1) Prerequisites for C++ code (apart from APIs)

   The C++ code is written under Linux, it compiles with GNU gcc/g++ 4.7.2.
   It may compile with other gcc versions as well. At present, the code does
   not compile under Windows or Mac. Having said that, the code is basic,
   porting it should not be difficult (please contribute a port if you did
   one).

2) Prerequisites for Python code and Python API to C++ code

   The Python code is written in Python 2.7, it may work for earlier Python
   2.x versions as well. It does not run in Python 3.x.

   You also need recent versions of NumPy (code written with version 1.7.1)
   and SciPy (code written with version 0.12.0).
   The API requires Cython (code written with version 0.19) and the distutils
   module.

3) Prerequisites for Matlab code and Matlab API to C++ code

   The Matlab code is written in Matlab 8, it may work for earlier versions
   of Matlab as well. It does not run in Octave.

   The Matlab API is a set of MEX functions. The MEX interface is a part of
   any Matlab installation. Unfortunately, it is not a portable API. The
   present code is tested under Linux. It does not compile under Windows or
   Mac. Again, a port should not be difficult to do (please contribute a port
   if you did one).

Building the Python API
=======================

The Python API interfaces C++ code by way of Cython.
Denote the repository root by [ROOT].

* Configure setup.py

  Make sure that both Cython and distutils are present.

  $ cd [ROOT]/python/cython
  $ cp apbsint_profile.py.template apbsint_profile.py

  Edit apbsint_profile.py. 'get_include_dirs' must return include directories,
  'get_library_dirs' library directories for the C++ compiler and linker.
  Make sure to use absolute pathnames.

  In particular, the list returned by 'get_include_dirs' must include [ROOT]
  (absolute pathname).

* Build

  $ cd [ROOT]/python/cython
  $ make

  This should produce a number of shared libraries, most important
  [ROOT]/python/apbsint/eptools_ext.so (all shared libraries are moved
  to [ROOT]/python/apbsint). The suffix may be different from '.so' for
  your system.

* Extend Python sys.path

  Insert [ROOT]/python into the module search path sys.path. If
  you use IPython, you can do the following. Locate your profile:

  $ ipython locate profile

  Go there and edit the file ipython_config.py. Look for sys.path, or just
  append the following to the end::

    import sys
    sys.path.append('[ROOT]/python')

* Test

  There is some test code in [ROOT]/python/test/. For example:

  $ cd [ROOT]/python/test/binclass
  $ ipython eptest_binclass.py

  This should run some simple binary classification example. You can edit
  eptest_binclass.py and thereby test different aspects.

Building the Matlab API
=======================

Note: The main focus of ApBsInT is on Python development. The Matlab API should
be regarded as add-on, which we mainly use to debug and test the Python code.
Also, while Cython and distutils are portable across different platforms, this
is not the case for the Matlab MEX API. If you are working on Windows or Mac,
you may have to do some serious porting (please contribute a port if you did
one).

Denote the repository root by [ROOT].

* Prerequisites

  Make sure you have a fairly recent version of Matlab, and that you can
  compile MEX files (Matlab mex command).

* Configure make.inc.def

  $ cd [ROOT]/matlab
  $ cp make.inc.example make.inc.def

  Edit make.inc.def. You have to set::

    ROOTDIR=[ROOT]

  Also, check the other variables and make sure this makes sense for your
  system. In particular, set EXINCS_MATLAB to the XXX/extern/include
  directory for your Matlab installation (it has to contain mex.h).

  Matlab MEX creates shared libraries, whose filenames have a specific
  suffix (.mexglx or .mexa64 in Linux). Find out what this is for you, and
  set MEXSUFFIX accordingly.

* Build

  $ cd [ROOT]/matlab
  $ make

  This should produce MEX shared libraries in [ROOT]/matlab/bin.

* Modify Matlab path

  The directory [ROOT]/matlab and its subdirectories must be in the
  Matlab path. The Matlab script [ROOT]/matlab/startup.m adds them.
  In order to run this script automatically when starting Matlab, add the
  following to your ~/matlab/startup.m file::

    s=pwd;
    cd(strcat(getenv('HOME'),'[ROOT]/matlab'));
    startup;
    cd(s); clear('s');

* Test

  There is some test code in [ROOT]/matlab/test/. For example, try to run
  [ROOT]/matlab/test/binclass/eptest_binclass.m. This should run some
  simple binary classification example. You can edit the code and thereby
  test different aspects.

Documentation
=============

A bit patchy for now. In particular, there is not much user documentation
right now. Look into [ROOT]/doc.

* [ROOT]/doc/techreps/ep_toolbox.pdf: Technical report with details about
  the Expectation Propagation (EP) part of ApBsInT

* [ROOT]/doc/design: Some files describing design aspects

Apart from that, example and test code for the Matlab API are in
[ROOT]/matlab/test/, for the Python API in [ROOT]/python/test/. Also,
the code is well documented.
